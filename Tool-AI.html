						<h2>A Shared Vision</h2>
						<div class="text">
							<p>
								It began with a question that belonged to everyone. And for
								once, the answers weren’t left to experts alone.
							</p>

							<p>How should artificial intelligence serve society?</p>

							<p>
								The meetings were held in the old community hall. The one that
								always smelled faintly of old books and cinnamon.
							</p>

							<p>Farmers came. Teachers. The elderly too.</p>

							<p>
								The conversations stretched late into the night. People argued,
								laughed, disagreed and still came back the next evening.
							</p>

							<p>By the end, it felt like we were imagining the same future.</p>

							<p>
								Technology would help people think, create and work. But it
								would never decide for them.
							</p>

							<p>
								It would extend human reach without replacing the human hand.
							</p>

							<p>We called the vision <i>Tool AI</i>.</p>

						<h2>Signing the Future</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>
								A few of us stood at the back, watching the flash of cameras as
								each page was signed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sunlight broke through the windows in thin, bright lines. It
								felt almost ceremonial
							</p>

							<p>
								The air felt heavy with equal measures of pride and exhaustion.
							</p>

							<p>
								The AI charter had taken months of late-night debates and
								revisions.
							</p>

							<p>
								People wanted to believe that if the limits came first then
								power could be managed before it spread too far.
							</p>

							<p>
								But no one thought a document could guarantee that kind of
								control.
							</p>
							<p>And no one was celebrating. Not yet.</p>

						<h2>The First Registry</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>The first compute registry office was small.</p>

							<p>
								Just a few service desks and bright screens. The kind that made
								your eyes ache after a while.
							</p>

							<p>But people lined up outside before sunrise.</p>

							<p>
								Most were developers waiting to register the systems they had
								built.
							</p>

							<p>
								Inside, the staff issued licenses and explained how the new
								regulations worked.
							</p>

							<p>For once, the future didn’t feel distant or abstract.</p>

							<p>It felt close, understandable and almost human.</p>

						<h2>Testing the System</h2>
						<div class="text">
							<p>They called them safety drills.</p>

							<p>
								Teams of developers and auditors met twice a year to test their
								systems against the city’s safety standards.
							</p>

							<p>The days were slow and the work was repetitive.</p>

							<p>Each line of code was checked, logged, and checked again.</p>

							<p>
								Most developers called it bureaucracy. Others called it
								pre-caution.
							</p>

							<p>No one enjoyed it, but everyone understood why it mattered.</p>

							<p>
								The reports were sent straight to the city archive and open to
								anyone who cared enough to have a look.

						<h2>The Second Pair of Hands</h2>
						<div class="text">
							<p>
								When I got my first job, I used to stop by the corner shop on my
								way to the train station.
							</p>

							<p>The one run by a woman named Asha.</p>

							<p>
								She managed everything herself. Orders, marketing, even taxes.
							</p>

							<p>
								When developers rolled out a new AI-commerce model, Asha signed
								up the first week.
							</p>

							<p>
								At first it just helped her track inventory and deliveries. Then
								it started predicting which items would sell fastest, with an
								accuracy that felt almost unsettling.
							</p>

							<p>
								She said it was like having a second pair of hands that never
								got tired.
							</p>

							<p>It wasn’t perfect though.</p>
							<p>
								One time, the system ordered the wrong supplies and she spent a
								week untangling the mess.
							</p>

							<p>Even smart systems need supervision sometimes.</p>

							<p>
								Asha’s shop never became a company, but it never closed either.
							</p>

							<p>Somehow, that felt like success.</p>

						<h2>Department of Truth</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>One of the students admitted it by accident.</p>
							<p>
								She had used AI to make a video of her teacher doing a silly
								dance.
							</p>
							<p>“It was just a prank,” she said.</p>
							<p>
								When the report reached the AI Crimes Department, no one
								laughed.
							</p>
							<p>
								It turned out there had been dozens of deepfakes that month.
							</p>
							<p>Most were jokes. Some were not.</p>
							<p>The analysis seemed more like detective work.</p>
							<p>
								They studied reflections in eyes and the shape of light on a
								cheek.
							</p>
							<p>Most were crude and easy to spot. Others were near perfect.</p>
							<p>
								Sometimes the department held open workshops to teach citizens
								how to spot manipulated media for themselves.
							</p>
							<p>
								It was slow work, but little by little, people learned to
								question everything they saw.

						<h2>The New Lesson Plan</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>I was never a great student. In fact, I hated books.</p>

							<p>
								I learned best when I could watch someone do the thing instead
								of just reading about it. So I used to binge-watch videos on
								YouTube the night before an exam, hoping things would finally
								make sense.
							</p>

							<p>
								The education ministry knew there were plenty of students like
								me.
							</p>
							<p>
								Eventually, they approved the use of AI tutors in the classroom.
							</p>

							<p>
								Some parents worried it meant more screen time, but teachers
								said it helped students learn in their own ways.
							</p>

							<p>
								If a student learned faster through sound or movement, the
								system noticed and adjusted.
							</p>

							<p>
								Plus the teachers didn’t disappear. They still walked between
								the desks and smiled when someone finally understood something
								that had seemed impossible a few days before.

						<h2>The Arm That Moved</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>The city hospital had been running trials for months.</p>
							<p>
								And when the story broke, it was all over the news for weeks.
							</p>
							<p>
								A short clip of a man lifting his hand for the first time in ten
								years.
							</p>
							<p>It was the city’s first AI-assisted prosthetic arm.</p>
							<p>
								Doctors, engineers, and patients trained it together.
								Continuously testing and adjusting until it reacted the way they
								wanted.
							</p>
							<p>
								The hospital didn’t intend to make the headlines. It was just
								another AI research initiative.
							</p>
							<p>But something about it caught people’s attention.</p>
							<p>
								Maybe it was the way the patient smiled when the arm responded
								correctly.
							</p>
							<p>It became a quiet symbol of what the city had promised.</p>
							<p>Machines built to serve humanity, not to outgrow it.</p>

						<h2>The Blueprint</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>
								As a kid, I used to ride my bike to the edge of the city just to
								look at the skyline.
							</p>
							<p>
								The streets were an endless stretch of glass towers and cranes
								always reaching higher.
							</p>
							<p>No one talked about what it cost to keep it all running.</p>
							<p>Eventually, the grid couldn’t keep up.</p>
							<p>
								Power outages swept through the city, and the protests followed
								soon after.
							</p>
							<p>But things are different now.</p>
							<p>
								The planners use AI to test their ideas before they break
								ground. Everything is simulated before it touches the real
								world.
							</p>
							<p>The city still grows. Just not at our expense</p>

						<h2>Talk to the City</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>
								They told us the initiative would close the gap between the
								people and the government.
							</p>
							<p>
								It started with a few public kiosks where anyone could walk up
								to ask a question or make a complaint.
							</p>
							<p>
								An AI assistant grouped similar requests and tracked responses
								over time.
							</p>
							<p>
								Most people were shy at first. Then the lines started forming.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some came to report broken streetlights or delays at the train
								station.
							</p>
							<p>
								Others asked harder questions. About housing, jobs, and
								healthcare.
							</p>
							<p>
								It began as an experiment, but it started shaping real policy.
							</p>
							<p>
								Streetlights got repaired faster and council workers began
								visiting neighborhoods again.
							</p>
							<p>
								They say this is what progress should feel like. And maybe, this
								time, they’re right.

				<!-- NOTE -->
				<div class="conclusion">
					<p>The city isn’t perfect.</p>
					<p>Neither is AI</p>
					<p>It still makes mistakes.</p>
					<p>And on most days, it feels like we’re learning together.</p>
					<p>Still, I’ve grown to like it this way.</p>
