			<h1>How We Got Here</h1>

			<p>
				This project is based on two companion books, told through the eyes of
				two fictional narrators living in distant cities. Each reflects on what
				it felt like to watch their world change as artificial intelligence
				became part of everyday life.
			</p>

			<p>
				The two cities took opposite paths in how they developed and governed
				AI. One kept it as a tool and the other let it grow beyond control.
			</p>

			<p>
				Across ten key moments captured between 2027 and 2030, each narrator
				records their city’s story as a series of personal and collective
				experiences.
			</p>

			<p>
				The project was inspired by the essay
