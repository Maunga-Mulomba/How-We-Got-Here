						<h2>Big Tech Rules</h2>
						<div class="text">
							<p>I wasn’t in the room when it all started. None of us were.</p>

							<p>But we heard how it happened.</p>

							<p>
								Quiet meetings and private dinners. The kind where everyone
								already agrees before they sit down.
							</p>

							<p>
								They didn’t argue about whether they should build something
								smarter than people. That question had already gone soft.
							</p>

							<p>
								They were figuring out how to make it happen and how to sell the
								idea to the rest of us.
							</p>

							<p>
								They talked about innovation and economic growth. It all sounded
								so reasonable.
							</p>

							<p>But in reality, it was about money and power.</p>

							<p>It always was.</p>

						<h2>The Deal of the Century</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>I remember when they finally went public.</p>

							<p>Suits, cameras, and smiles all around.</p>

							<p>
								The deal had a name I’ve long forgotten, but everyone just
								called it progress.
							</p>

							<p>
								The tech executives said it would make the country stronger and
								that waiting would mean falling behind.
							</p>

							<p>
								The government officials listened carefully, asked their
								questions, then signed on.
							</p>

							<p>Maybe they believed it. Maybe they couldn’t afford not to.</p>

							<p>Some protesters urged caution.</p>

							<p>
								They said the rush toward superintelligent AI would bring
								consequences no one could contain.
							</p>

							<p>
								But warning signs don’t photograph well, and headlines prefer
								optimism.

						<h2>The Ground That Fed Us</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>
								It started quietly with surveyors and stakes in the ground on
								cheap land outside the old towns.
							</p>

							<p>
								This used to be farmland. Families had lived here for
								generations and planted in the same soil their grandparents had
								worked on.
							</p>

							<p>Then the letters came.</p>

							<p>
								The area was rezoned for "industrial use" and relocation
								packages went out under a public–private partnership.
							</p>

							<p>
								They only offered enough compensation to make leaving feel like
								a choice.
							</p>

							<p>
								Within a few months, the heavy machines rolled in, and the
								ground shook for weeks as the first concrete slabs went down.
							</p>

							<p>
								The water levels in the reservoirs dropped as the servers
								multiplied, and in some towns the lights flickered for the first
								time in years.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now the horizon is rows of gray buildings humming through the
								night.
							</p>

							<p>
								They call them data centers, but they grow like cities and each
								one is a little bigger than the last.

						<h2>Agents in the Wild</h2>
						<div class="text">
							<p>No one knew what those massive buildings were really for</p>

							<p>At least not at first.</p>
							<p>
								Then came the press event. That was when it all clicked. All
								that concrete and wiring had been building toward this.
							</p>

							<p>
								They called it an autonomous business agent. It could plan,
								reason, and negotiate deals with almost no human guidance.
							</p>

							<p>
								The demo looked harmless enough. Two developers from one of the
								big tech firms smiled as their creation answered questions
								faster than anyone could keep up.
							</p>

							<p>It sounded calm. And almost.....human.</p>

							<p>The audience saw possibility. The companies saw profit.</p>

							<p>
								And somewhere in between, the rest of us didn’t notice how much
								control we had already given away.

						<h2>We're Closed</h2>
						<div class="text">
							<p>
								When the new AI models came out, the stock markets went crazy.
							</p>

							<p>
								They said the new tools would make work easier and not replace
								the workers. Of course we had seen this play out before. But
								this time it was different.
							</p>

							<p>
								As usual analysts called it the new industrial revolution. I
								simply called it the week my job disappeared.
							</p>

							<p>
								Companies were soon downsized and departments that had survived
								previous waves of automation closed almost overnight.
							</p>

							<p>
								Most of us tried to adapt. We signed up for retraining programs,
								learned new tools, and applied for whatever was left.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the systems didn’t need help. They learned faster than we
								did.
							</p>

							<p>
								And they didn’t make the mistakes we had come to expect from
								earlier models — or from people.

						<h2>AI-Photo Gate</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>The story began with a photo from a small newsroom</p>

							<p>
								A government official, a well-known investor, and an exchange
								that looked like a bribe.
							</p>
							<p>The image quickly went viral.</p>

							<p>Two days later, the newsroom issued a correction.</p>

							<p>
								The photo was fake and was in fact an AI composite made by an
								opposition political party.
							</p>

							<p>
								A formal apology was issued and a few people lost their jobs.
								But the damage had already been done.
							</p>

							<p>
								People said it was a wake-up call for stronger safeguards
								against AI.
							</p>

							<p>But nothing changed.</p>

							<p>Everybody moved on and the outrage died a quiet death.</p>

						<h2>The City Beneath the City</h2>
						<div class="text">
							<p>Most of them didn’t set out to become criminals</p>

							<p>It happened slowly. After too many closed doors.</p>

							<p>And it just became too easy to do</p>

							<p>All it took was a fast connection and a bit of nerve.</p>

							<p>AI handled all of the work</p>

							<p>
								The money started moving in ways no one could trace and
								sometimes entire databases were rewritten in a few hours.
							</p>

							<p>
								Many were lone actors scattered across the city. With a few
								clicks, anyone could do what once required a coordinated team.
							</p>

							<p>
								The police still called it organized crime, but there was
								nothing organized about it.

						<h2>Chain of Command</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>The military never said much about its AI programs.</p>

							<p>
								Most of what we knew came from leaked footage and half-heard
								rumors.
							</p>

							<p>
								Every now and then, we got headlines about an intercepted threat
								or even a precision strike due a “technical error.”
							</p>

							<p>
								They said their systems were only for decision support, though
								no one outside the bases ever knew what that meant.
							</p>

							<p>
								Some said the machines just analyzed satellite images. Others
								said they made recommendations. And a few believed they were
								already giving orders.
							</p>

							<p>Either way, the truth stayed classified.</p>

						<h2>Keeping A Watchful Eye</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>It didn’t happen all at once.</p>

							<p>
								First came the cameras. Then the traffic sensors and before we
								knew it, AI-assisted drones hovered above every street
							</p>

							<p>
								Even crossing the street two seconds late could trigger a
								notification of a fine on your phone before you’d taken your
								next step.
							</p>

							<p>They called it modernization. A smarter and safer city.</p>

							<p>
								People got used to them. The cameras stopped feeling like eyes
								and more like part of the street furniture.
							</p>

							<p>
								Every transaction, conversation and movement was logged
								somewhere.
							</p>
							<p>Nothing was private anymore</p>

							<p>They said it kept us safe. Maybe it did.</p>

							<p>
								But the safety started to feel a lot like mass surveillance.

						<h2>The Announcement</h2>

						<div class="text">
							<p>
								There was no fireworks or a countdown. Just a press release.
							</p>

							<p>At first, no one believed it.</p>

							<p>
								It sounded like another marketing stunt. The kind of headline
								that disappears by morning.
							</p>

							<p>But the reports kept coming in.</p>

							<p>A panel of researchers verified the tests.</p>
							<p>
								The system had passed every benchmark, and then invented new
								ones of its own.
							</p>

							<p>
								Within hours, governments declared emergency reviews. Other labs
								demanded access to replicate the results.

							<p>I did not sleep that night. Neither did anyone I knew.</p>
